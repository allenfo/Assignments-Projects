wrestler.cpp

Import the file to flip. Make sure there is a wrestler.txt file in the directory. I have provided three different ones that should be changed
or more can be added. To compile, copy and paste or type the line 

g++ -std=c++11 wrestler.cpp wrestler.h main.cpp -o run

To run the file type then hit enter:

run wrestler.txt

wrestler.txt can be replaced with any .txt file that follows the format so wrestler1.txt, wrestler2.txt.....wrestlern.txt are all usable.

I did not sort the names but they are all on the correct teams.
